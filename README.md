# JoyForAll
_Designed for Unity3D_

## Why use this?
Participating in a GameJam? Need a way to add joystick support but don't have time to code and test for dozens of possible combinations of controllers. Give JoyForAll a try.

## What does this do?
* Provides the ability to set a controller (joystick) in game.
** When the Configure Joystick canvas is loaded, the current mappings are destroyed and the onscreen instructions walk the player through setting up their individual joystick.
* Provides the ability to store that controller in PlayerPrefs for the user.
** Can be configured to destory on each game load, or be persistant
* Provides the ability to set a hotkey to activiate the joystick configure screen "backspace"
* Default keyboard keys can be configured for non-joystick usage

## How do I use this?
* Copy the .unitypackage into your assets folder, and you're good to go.
* Example scene and scripts show what's available right now.
